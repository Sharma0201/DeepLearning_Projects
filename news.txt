In order to restrict users from retweeting any tweet before opening the article and reading it, Twitter had started a prompt feature back in June. The support handle of Twitter had tweeted saying, “Sharing an article can spark conversation, so you may want to read it before you Tweet it. To help promote informed discussion, we're testing a new prompt on Android ― when you Retweet an article that you haven't opened on Twitter, we may ask if you'd like to open it first.” This prompt would ask a user to be sure if they would wish to share the article before reading it on the platform.
